/**
 * Zoned date and time conversion in action.
 * This app gives an idea about how to convert from one zoned date and time to another in a distributed system.
 *
 * Consider the following story: Mike wants to book a meeting with Fred in St Louis USA
 * Mike lives in the Europe/London time zone, and he created a calendar appointment by entering a date and time for when a phone call with Fred will occur.
 * A meeting invitation was sent to Fred. When Fred views the invitation, it should reflect his time zone: USA Central.
 * The vital point is that the meeting will be held at the same instant worldwide; therefore, the code uses the Instant object for persistence,
 * and without any time zone knowledge, the objectâ€™s value should be only in UTC. The rest of the story is shown in the code comments.
