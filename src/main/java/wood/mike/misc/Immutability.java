/**
 * Don't provide "setter" methods â€” methods that modify fields or objects referred to by fields.
 * Make all fields final and private.
 * Don't allow subclasses to override methods. The simplest way to do this is to declare the class as final.
   A more sophisticated approach is to make the constructor private and construct instances in factory methods.
 * If the instance fields include references to mutable objects, don't allow those objects to be changed:
        * Don't provide methods that modify the mutable objects.
        * Don't share references to the mutable objects. Never store references to external, mutable objects passed to the constructor;
          if necessary, create copies, and store references to the copies. Similarly, create copies of your internal mutable objects when
          necessary to avoid returning the originals in your methods.
